## Introduction
AudioCraft is a framework that simplifies the process of generating high-quality audio, including music, from text prompts. This repository demonstrates how to use AudioCraft to generate music based on textual input. The generated music can be used for creative projects, background scores, or experimentation.

## Features
- Generate music from text descriptions.
- Leverage pre-trained models from AudioCraft for high-quality audio generation.
- Easy-to-use scripts for music generation.
- Customizable parameters for controlling the output.

## Installation
To use this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abm984/Music-Generation.git
   cd music-generation-audiocraft
   ```

2. **Set up a Python environment:**
   It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   Install the required Python packages using `pip`.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Install AudioCraft:**
   AudioCraft is not available on PyPI, so you need to install it from the source. Follow the official [AudioCraft installation guide](https://github.com/facebookresearch/audiocraft) to set it up.

## Usage
To generate music from text, use the provided script `generate_music.py`.

1. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   python app.py --text "A joyful and uplifting melody with a fast tempo"
   ```

2. **Customize parameters:**
   You can customize the generation process by modifying the script or passing additional arguments:
   - `--text`: The text prompt describing the music.
   - `--duration`: Duration of the generated music in seconds (default: 10).
   - `--output`: Output file name (default: `output.wav`).

   Example:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py 
   ```

3. **Output:**
   The generated music will be saved as a `.wav` file in the specified output location.

## Examples
Here are some example text prompts you can use to generate music:
- "A dramatic orchestral piece with heavy drums and strings."
- "A futuristic electronic track with a fast beat and synth melodies."
- "A soothing ambient track with soft pads and gentle rhythms."
